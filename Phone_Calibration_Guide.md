# Phone Calibration

If you want to use an Android device which is currently not supported in [supported Android devices list](Supported_Android_Devices.md), you can calibrate the phone model specs by yourself using the PhoneCalibration sample.

First, setup all necessary project settings for Android. If you don't know how to do that, please see [Android project settings tutorial](README.md#HoloKit Unity SDK##How to Use HoloKit Unity SDK###Project Settings####Android Project Settings). After finishing all project settings, import `PhoneModelSpecsCalibration` sample from Unity editor's package manager.
